# admixfrog_work
Commands and code relating to the work I have undertaken in admixfrog

Overall, contains many scripts. 

To use the commands listed in 'streamlined_code.R' the packages and commands created in 'lib.R' must first be loaded in. Otherwise it cannot create the plots. 

Others: initial_image / readingin_data are just to create the dataframes necessary for further analyses. 

linear_regression.R is to do with calculating the heterozygosities based on the VCF files created on the          basis of admixfrog work, and the low coverage files sans the missing data. 

This is much the same for: binding_frames / binding_snps , which create whole-genome files necessary for later analyses. 

binplots.R creates images similar to Figs 8, 9, 29, S3. 

den_anc.R creates Fig 11.

anc_proportions.R calculates ancestry proportions for each individual.

Commands and code relating to the work I have undertaken in admixfrog

Overall, contains many scripts - some of them are more useful than others. 

To use the commands listed in 'streamlined_code.R' the packages and commands created in 'lib.R' must first be loaded in. Otherwise it cannot create the plots. 

Others: initial_image / readingin_data are just to create the dataframes necessary for further analyses. 

This is much the same for: binding_frames / binding_snps , which create whole-genome files necessary for later analyses.
